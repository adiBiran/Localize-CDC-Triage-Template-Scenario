# Localize the CDC Triage Template Scenario


The COVID-19 Triage template is aligned with the scenarios published on the [CDC open source](https://github.com/CDCgov/covid19healthbot) repository. To ensure the localized strings are included within the open-source scenario, the localization is done using a switch statement within the scenario itself, rather than using the built-in Healthcare Bot localization manager. This means that customers wishing to introduce a new locale should apply their specific localized strings to the same switch.

**Note:** Customers should take into account that importing changes from the CDC open-source repository will overwrite these modifications. Customers will need to repeat the listed steps after applying any future update from the CDC-CORE protocol.

**The strings in this tutorial are aligned with the COVID-19 Triage template version as of 6th April 2020.**

## How to apply a new language within the template CORE scenario
In this tutorial we will walk you through 3 steps to apply a new language to the COVID-19 - CORE PROTOCOL scenario, using the Healthcare Bot built-in localization. In this sample, we will add the British English (en-GB) locale.

In this tutorial, we explain how to localize the strings in the COVID-19 - CORE PROTOCOL scenario. The same method can be used to localize the COVID-19 - CDC WRAPPER scenario.

### Step 1: Add the default locale Action step
All the strings in the COVID-19 - CORE PROTOCOL scenario are pre-defined in a dedicated Action step. There is an individual Action step for each set of strings in each of the pre-delivered languages: American English (en-us), Korean (ko-kr), Vietnamese (vi-vn), Chinese Simplified (zh-cn) and Spanish-US (es-us).
A switch statement routes to the selected set of hard-coded strings based on the conversation locale, as you can see in the snapshots:

Edit the COVID-19 - CORE PROTOCOL scenario, add the marked Action steps, and link them to the Switch default route:

### Step 2: Edit the default locale Action steps
Now we want to initialize the scenario strings using the built-in Healthcare Bot localization, rather than hard-coded values. For that, we will use the function `session.getCustomLocalizedValue` with a new set of string IDs. 

Edit each of the Action steps and copy into it the content from the corresponding JSON file from [Actions](./Actions) folder.

### Step 3: Add the language resources to the Built-in localization manager
The last step is to create strings with the IDs of step #2. This can be done either manually, or by [importing excel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/HealthBot/localization#import-logic) with the full set of IDs.

In the Healthcare Bot management portal navigate to the Localization management page (Language > Localization) and import the [core_protocol_strings](./core_protocol_strings.xlsx) excel file localized for British English (en-gb). 
To enable other languages, edit the excel file, and add a column for each required language and re-import it. Learn more about the [built-in localization manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/HealthBot/localization).

## Outcome
You can now go back to the scenario and run it using the `en-gb` locale.
If you have completed the configuration and customization correctly you should see the following localized question:
